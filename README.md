Here's a guide to get you started with SwapBloo locally:

**Prerequisites:**

Â Â * **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://nodejs.org/)

**Installing Dependencies:**

1.Â Â **Install Packages:** Run the following command in your terminal to install the necessary dependencies for SwapBloo:

Â Â Â Â ```
Â Â Â Â npm install
Â Â Â Â ```

Â Â Â Â This will download the required packages from the npm registry and install them in your project's `node_modules` folder.

**Starting the Development Server:**

1.Â Â **Run Development Server:** Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using this command:

Â Â Â Â ```
Â Â Â Â npm run dev
Â Â Â Â ```

This will typically start a local server on localhost.

**By following these steps, you'll be ready to begin developing and testing SwapBloo locally.**
